# Linux Resource Usage Tracker

## Project Overview
The Linux Resource Usage Tracker is a Python-based tool designed to monitor system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk usage. The tool runs in the background as a service and sends notification emails whenever resource usage exceeds a specified threshold.

## Features
- Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage in real-time.
- Sends email notifications when any resource usage exceeds 85%.
- Includes details of the top 3 resource-consuming processes in the notification email.
- Can be configured to run as a systemd service for continuous monitoring in the background.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3** installed on the system.
2. **Git** installed on the system.
3. A **Gmail account** with app password enabled for sending notifications.
4. **Linux environment**, e.g., AWS EC2 with Amazon Linux 2.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chinmaya-chhatre/linux-resource-usage-tracker.git
cd linux-resource-usage-tracker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Update Email Configuration
Update the `resource_tracker.py` script with your sender email and app password:
- Replace `aws.xxxx@gmail.com` with your Gmail address.
- Replace `udqs xxxx xxxx alat` with your Gmail app password.
- Replace the recipient email (`aws.xxxx@gmail.com`) with your desired email.

## Usage

### Running as a Service
To run the script continuously in the background, configure it as a systemd service.

#### 1. Create a Systemd Service File
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/resource-tracker.service
```

Add the following content to the file:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Linux Resource Usage Tracker
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/ec2-user/linux-resource-tracker/resource_tracker.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/ec2-user/linux-resource-tracker
Restart=always
User=ec2-user
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Note:** Update the `ExecStart` and `WorkingDirectory` paths to match the location of your script.

#### 2. Reload Systemd
Reload the systemd daemon to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### 3. Start the Service
Start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start resource-tracker.service
```

#### 4. Enable the Service on Boot
Ensure the service starts automatically on reboot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable resource-tracker.service
```

#### 5. Verify Service Status
Check the status of the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl status resource-tracker.service
```

### Stopping the Service
If you need to stop the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop resource-tracker.service
```

### Logs
To view logs generated by the service:
```bash
journalctl -u resource-tracker.service
```

## Testing the Application
To test the application:
1. Simulate high CPU usage using the `yes` command:
   ```bash
   yes > /dev/null &
   ```
2. Monitor your email for notifications.
3. Stop the `yes` command after testing:
   ```bash
   killall yes
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for logging resource usage to a file.
- Extend functionality to support Slack or other notification platforms.
- Add a web interface for visualizing historical resource usage trends.
